<h1 class="_level1_page_">Welcome to CMSimple 5</h1>
<h1>Welcome to CMSimple 5</h1>
<p><img class="tplge_right" src="userfiles/images/coffee.png" alt="">Congratulations on your new installation of <strong>CMSimple</strong>. You can login now with the default password, which you will find in the readme.php of the download.</p>
<p>This is the new CMSimple 5, as you get it "out of the box". You see the standard contents and the default template of CMSimple 5.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; background: #900; color: #ffffff; padding: 4px 6px;">
<p>!!! Remember to change the login password&nbsp; immediately !!!</p>
<p>Please read the readme.php in the root folder of the download.</p>
</div>
<p>CMSimple is published under GPL3 License. More information about CMSimple, a very simple and easy to use CMS (Content Management System) without database, the documentation and the current Downloads you will find on the CMSimple Homepage:</p>
<p><strong><a href="../">cmsimple.org »</a></strong></p>
<p>Here you will find a Demo-Website with CMSimple and a lot of Plugins, extending the functionality of CMSimple:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ge-webdesign.de/plugindemo/">CMSimple Plugin Demo Pages (German) »</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 style="font-size: 18px;"><img src="userfiles/images/flags/en.gif" alt="" width="18" height="12"> !!! Important Hint !!!</h2>
<p>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> change the password directly in config.php by using a text editor. Change the default password right away after login <strong>ONLINE</strong>.</p>
<p>For editing CMSimple files it is essential to <strong>USE ONLY</strong> editors, capable of detecting, opening and saving files as "utf-8 without BOM" (Byte Order Mark), like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a>.</p>
<p>If this condition is not fulfilled, you will damage your CMSimple installation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 style="font-size: 18px;"><img src="userfiles/images/flags/de.gif" alt="" width="18" height="12"> !!! Wichtiger Hinweis !!!</h2>
<p>Bitte ändern Sie das Standard Passwort <strong>NICHT</strong> direkt in der config.php mit einem Text Editor. Ändern Sie das Standard Passwort nach dem Login <strong>ONLINE.</strong></p>
<p>Zur Bearbeitung der CMSimple Systemdateien sollten Sie ausschliesslich einen <strong>Code Editor</strong> wie z. B.&nbsp;<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad++</a> benutzen, der die Codierung "utf-8 ohne BOM" (Byte Order Mark) erkennt, die Dateien so öffnet und auch wieder abspeichert.</p>
<p>Wenn Sie die Systemdateien in einer anderen Codierung als "utf-8 ohne BOM" abspeichern, kann es zu Problemen mit verschiedenen Funktionen von CMSimple kommen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The CMSimple links</h2>
<p>If you use an original or modified CMSimple template, please leave the template-link at the bottom of the template. You may extend that link this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Template by <a href="https://www.cmsimple.org">CMSimple</a> modified by <a href="https://www.cmsimple.org">your link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you use another template inside a CMSimple installation, I kindly ask that you link back to <a href="https://www.cmsimple.org">www.cmsimple.org</a> in your template, since this is a nice way to popularize the CMSimple Project and of giving something back.</p>
<h1 class="_level1_page_">Menulevels and Headings</h1>
<h1>Menulevels &amp; Headings</h1>
<p>With CMSimple 5 you can use 6 menulevels by default:</p>
<p><strong><a href="?sitemap">Take a look at the full page structure »</a></strong></p>
<p>Headings h1 with the CSS classes&nbsp; "_level<strong>1</strong>_page_ "... "_level<strong>6</strong>_page_"&nbsp; will dynamically split the document into new pages:</p>
<p class="tplge_code">&lt;h1 class="_level1_page_"&gt;Menu Levels and Headings&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p>CMSimple includes a pagemanager that simplifies creating, renaming, moving and deleting of pages. Even complete folders with subfolders can be moved or deleted with Pagemanager.</p>
<p>Thus it should be no problem to get rid of the contents of this standard download. Alternatively you could start with the present page structure, rename pages and overwrite the contents.</p>
